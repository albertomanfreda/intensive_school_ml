        "\n",
        "A **text file** is a computer file that only contains plain text - that is a sequence of binary representations of characters, in some **encoding**. The term is often used in opposition to **binary file**, which may contain any kind of binary sequence. Images, audio, executables etc, are all binary files in this respect. Microsoft Office / Libre Office documents (e.g. Word) or pdf files are also **not** text files, even thought they contain text. That's because they always also store other informations about formatting, page structures and so on. Conversely, a plain text file cannot use special formatting, such as bold or italic, nor can it host tables or images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conventionally, text files have the *.txt* extension, though that is by no mean a rule (nor a guarantee). Source code files, like Python scripts with the *.py* extension or C code files with the *.c* extension, are also text files. Another common extension is *.csv* (Comma-separated Values).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mind that, even when a *.txt* or *.csv* file contains numbers, their internal representation is much different from what it would be in a binary file, as each digits of the number is represented as a distinct text character, with the corrisponding bit sequence. For example, in a text file with ASCII encoding,the number 17 will be represented as the encoding for number 1 (00011111), followed by that for number 7 (00100101). This is much different from the binary representation of the integer number 17 (00010001). Of course, the same difference exists between the string '17' and the integer number 17: they are very different objects in memory!\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports operation on both text or binary files. However we will mostly talk about text files, here.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: There are many possible encodings for text files (ASCII, UTF-8, ANSI, UTF-16, etc...) and different OS uses different default encodings. On top of that, there is also the issue of **endianess**, that is the order of bytes inside a word of multiple bytes. Again, different devices (hard disk, network, etc...) may use different endianess. Discussing these kind of crazyness will take hours, but hopefully you need not to care about that most of the time, unless you are working with files produced by different systems. In that case, be ready to bite the bullet.\n"
